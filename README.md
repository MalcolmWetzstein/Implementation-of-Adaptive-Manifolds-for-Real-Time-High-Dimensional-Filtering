# Implementation of <i>Adaptive Manifolds for Real-Time High-Dimensional Filtering</i>
Implementation of the paper Adaptive Manifolds for Real-Time High-Dimensional Filtering by E. Gastal and M. Oliveira, 2012. Written for my class project in Computational Photography.

See original paper here: https://www.inf.ufrgs.br/~eslgastal/AdaptiveManifolds/

## Included in Repository

- C++ implementation (my code in a10.cpp and a10_main.cpp, other utility files supplied by course instructor).
- Applications including bilateral filter, non-local means denoising, depth of field effect.
- Assets for running applications.
- Class report and accompanying figures detailing performance.

## How to Run

Compiled using CMake, only tested on Linux so far.
